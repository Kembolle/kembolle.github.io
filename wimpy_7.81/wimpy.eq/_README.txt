To use a Graphic EQ renderer, include a reference to the wimpy.eq.js and the renderer you wish to use in your HTML.

Example:

	<!-- Wimpy Graphic EQ -->
	<script src="/wimpy/wimpy.eq/wimpy.eq.js"></script>
	<!-- Wimpy Graphic EQ Renderer-->
	<script src="/wimpy/wimpy.eq/renderers/Carbon.js"></script>
	
Renderers can vary depending on kind of music and EQ size (in pixels), so you're free to tweak the source code of the renderer, or develop your own.

A couple implementation examples are available in the "test" folder:

/wimpy/test/eq1.html
/wimpy/test/eq2.html
